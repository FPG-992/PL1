expected outputs:

Testcase: tree0
1 6 4 2 3 5

Testcase: tree1
1 7 5 11 4 12 2 3 8 6 9 10

Testcase: tree2
1 2 3

Testcase: tree9
1 2 5 3 4 6



i want an algorithm like that:

find at the lowest level the smallest value, make the subtree with the smallest value at the deepest level the left subtree of the tree.

check in the trees if the smallest value is on the left, if not we swap them.

the swaps should only be in the children of the nodes, we cannot swap nodes themselves. 

i want this in ML
